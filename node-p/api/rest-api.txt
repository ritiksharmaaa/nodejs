# rest full api term use in backend development : - 

how it diffrent from normal api 
 rest api is nothing but it a best practice way or rule to mske a api than we callled that api is rest api 


#server  client 

client is anything ex : - browser mobile alexa 

client request server response 

there is some rule or standard( not considered in market ) is used for request and response .

---------------------------

we use what industries used which sccalable .

1 rule : work on server and client architecture 

2 rule : server and client both are independent .

ex response : may be text image html json 

user get for blog : server fetch data from db and make html file and send it to you :

here IMPO : - if client is browser so it work well .  (WE call it SSR () server side rendering )

but what if mobile and alexa .  and here server decide how we have to structure a data in html .


----------

here our client is depend on server that they give data to me which is consume by me . 

--- in rest api  that is not happening we just send data to user and they have to decide what they have to do with that data . 

request came servert send data in paticular formate and client used it in own way . in past used xml now JSON data . 

client get data and rendered it in own way  we call it (CSR) client side rendering (it slow like react .) . 



---------------------if we have no that our client is browser so good practive to use html . 

if you have cross platform you have to use it rest html . 

3 rule : ---

always respect all http methods : my rule it we have to do it convenient . 

 good way to add custoom header 


htttp ----------------------------------------
header 

res.setheader("X-custome " : "new header ")

http status code ----------

100 to 199 : - infromation status 
200  to 299 : success status 
300 to 399 : redirect status  
400 to 499: client error response 
500  to 599 : server error
