# what we have to do in nodejs to build rest api 

rest api : - 

get /user - list all users 
get /user/1 - get the user with id 1 
get /user/2 - get the user with id 2

post /user - create user 

pathch /user/1 - edit the user data id 1 

delete /user/1 - delete the user id 1 .


hybride server : mean which ave both ssr renderening and csr : 

we want when request came : /user - we return html rendered data :

when :/ api/user  : it send json data 

dynamic path parameter : --

/user/:id == this collean tell you this is dynamic url
