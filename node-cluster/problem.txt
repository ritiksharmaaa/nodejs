why we require cluster :

because when we have multipl user in our one node server :

so concurenlty user increase load on node server increase : 

or user may face more waiting time to get response ....

in this situation we use cluster module of node js .

it create multilpe node server and manage server amoung thread .

how it work so we hava a main server ---> behind the main server we create multiple intance of server with same code .
