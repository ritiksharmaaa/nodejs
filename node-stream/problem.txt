why we requirement for  stream 

: ex 

we have text file inside file have some content and have 50 mb size .

we want to read  the contentn of file in and  send in response on hitting aurl each time when user click on that url .

when we read a file to send dat ato use first we read entire 400 mb data to in our memory than we are sending to user . 
so we have to first stored those 400 data to in memory than we send to user so here memory consumption is very high .

instead of storing in  our memeory we direct read one line send to user than remove those one line read next line and send to user . 

we call this functionality a stream .

meaning of stream : --- 

see youtube data come and it server it constantely .

same a stream is used there . 


we call it to stream read file in chunks . by chunks . 

we send this chunks to browser via response .  we call this pipeline 

how it work behind the seen : 

ctual we put header trancoding -encoding in chunks : 

so it tell brwoser dont collection the connection imediately getting reposne from server wait we send you data in chunks . so browser http not close connection until it stream not end .



------------------------project way looking stream ---

suppose we have to zip a file so first we have to read the content of file and we have to zip the file . and than we write to browser 

can it work for 400 mb file : if 400 file read 400 read now making 400mb file zib in memory so our memeory consumption is 800mp .


so our approch we use stream to read data but what about zibit make 400 zip file in memeory .
