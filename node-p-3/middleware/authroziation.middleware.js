// 1 middleware work to get user from token and put to req user 
// 2 miidleware is to put on routes o some content you see only if you login it . 

// another middleware base on subscription like have permssion or not we can put thisinfo in token but we cant store lot data in token .

//  all user authicated and they assess you web but there is some feature which is paid for think than you can use it so ho wthi shappen this happen via authorization .


// my logic  


// async function authrozitation(req , res , next ){
//     if (!req.user) return res.redirect("/user/login")
//     // call to db to see his permission table and grop of table where permssion group have if the user permisoon table have assess to paticualr feature subscriotion than do next else send to subscription page .

    
// }
